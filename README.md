# Markdown Previewer

I won't write much for this readme for now. Once I feel like fleshing out this project a bit more I will do it.

This project was made as a freeCodeCamp project.

Learning Points:
- displaying markdown on the web (turning markdown into html using marked.js library)
- learned how to use tailwind css a bit (honestly I still feel like bootstrap and css is better but it's all good, I need to get used to it)
- how to display code blocks and highlight it using highlight.js library
